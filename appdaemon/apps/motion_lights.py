# Args:
#
# sensor: binary sensor to use as trigger. several motion detectors are seperated with ,
# entity_on : entity to turn on when detecting motion, can be a light, script, scene or anything else that can be turned on. more lights are sepetated with ,
# entity_off : entity to turn off when detecting motion, can be a light, script or anything else that can be turned off. Can also be a scene which will be turned on. more lights are sepetated with ,
# delay: amount of time after turning on to turn off again. If not specified defaults to 60 seconds.
#
